</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">OUR POLICY</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Welcome to Tracks, Inc. (&ldquo;Tracks&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo; and/or &ldquo;our&rdquo;). This
    privacy policy has been created to provide information about our
    company and its video sharing mobile application services (together
    with the Site, the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;) to our users (&ldquo;you&rdquo;,
    &ldquo;your&rdquo;). This Privacy Policy sets forth Tracks 's policy
    with respect to information, including personally identifiable data
    (&ldquo;Personal Data&rdquo;), and other information that is
    collected from visitors to our website located at www. Tracks.com
    (the &ldquo;Site&rdquo;) and users of the Service.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">INFORMATION WE COLLECT</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">When you interact with us through the
    Service, we may collect Personal Data and other information from you,
    as further described below:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Personal Data That You Provide Through
    the Service: We collect Personal Data from you when you voluntarily
    provide such information such as when you register for access to the
    Service (for example, name and email address), use certain features
    of the Service, contact us with inquiries or respond to one of our
    surveys. Wherever Tracks collects Personal Data we make an effort to
    provide a link to this Privacy Policy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">By voluntarily providing us with
    Personal Data, you are consenting to our use of it in accordance with
    this Privacy Policy. If you provide Personal Data, you acknowledge
    and agree that such Personal Data may be transferred from your
    current location to the offices and servers of Tracks and the
    authorized third parties referred to herein located in the United
    States.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Non-Identifiable or Aggregated Data:
    When you interact with Tracks through the Service, we receive and
    store certain personally non-identifiable information (for example,
    geo-location and device ID). Such information, which is collected
    passively using various technologies, cannot presently be used to
    specifically identify you. Tracks may store such information itself
    or such information may be included in databases owned and maintained
    by Tracks affiliates, agents or service providers. The Service may
    use such information and pool it with other information to track, for
    example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of
    visitors to each page of our Site, the domain names of our visitors'
    Internet service providers, and how our users use and interact with
    the Service. Also, in an ongoing effort to better understand and
    serve the users of the Service, Tracks often conducts research on its
    customer demographics, interests and behavior based on the Personal
    Data and other information provided to us. This research may be
    compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis. Tracks may share this
    non-identifiable and aggregate data with its affiliates, agents and
    business partners, but this type of non-identifiable and aggregate
    information does not identify you personally. Tracks may also
    disclose aggregated user statistics in order to describe our Service
    to current and prospective business partners, and to other third
    parties for other lawful purposes.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In operating the Service, we may also
    use a technology called &quot;cookies.&quot; A cookie is a piece of
    information that the computer that hosts our Service gives to your
    browser when you access the Service. Our cookies help provide
    additional functionality to the Service and help us analyze Service
    usage more accurately. For instance, our Service may set a cookie on
    your browser that allows you to access the Service without needing to
    remember and then enter a password more than once when you are using
    the Service. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will not
    collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most web
    browsers, you will find a &ldquo;help&rdquo; section on the toolbar.
    Please refer to this section for information on how to receive
    notification when you are receiving a new cookie and how to turn
    cookies off. We recommend that you leave cookies turned on because
    they allow you to take advantage of some of the Service's features.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">OUR USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AND OTHER
    INFORMATION</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tracks uses the Personal Data you
    provide in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. If
    you provide Personal Data for a certain reason, we may use the
    Personal Data in connection with the reason for which it was
    provided. For instance, if you contact us by email, we will use the
    Personal Data you provide to answer your question or resolve your
    problem. Also, if you provide Personal Data in order to obtain access
    to the Service, we will use your Personal Data to provide you with
    access to such services and to monitor your use of such services.
    Tracks and its subsidiaries and affiliates (the &ldquo;Related
    Companies&rdquo;) may also use your Personal Data and other
    personally non-identifiable information collected through the Service
    to help us improve the content and functionality of the Service, to
    better understand our users and to improve the Service. Tracks and
    its Related Companies may use this information to communicate with
    you regarding the Service or to tell you about services (including
    those of our trusted partners) that we believe will be of interest to
    you. If we do so, each marketing communication we send you will
    contain instructions permitting you to &quot;opt-out&quot; of
    receiving future marketing communications. In addition, if at any
    time you wish not to receive any future communications or you wish to
    have your name deleted from our mailing lists, please contact us as
    indicated below. Note however that as a user of the Service you
    cannot opt-out of some administrative communications that are
    reasonably necessary to the Service, such as billing or service
    notifications.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">If Tracks intends on using any Personal
    Data in any manner that is not consistent with this Privacy Policy,
    you will be informed of such anticipated use prior to or at the time
    at which the Personal Data is collected.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">OUR DISCLOSURE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA
    AND OTHER INFORMATION</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tracks is not in the business of
    selling your information. We consider this information to be a vital
    part of our relationship with you. There are, however, certain
    circumstances in which we may share your Personal Data with certain
    third parties without further notice to you, as set forth below:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Business Transfers: As we develop our
    business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. In the event of
    a corporate sale, merger, reorganization, dissolution or similar
    event, Personal Data may be part of the transferred assets.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Related Companies: We may also share
    your Personal Data with our Related Companies for purposes consistent
    with this Privacy Policy.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Agents, Consultants and Related Third
    Parties: Tracks, like many businesses, sometimes hires other
    companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of
    such functions include mailing information, maintaining databases and
    processing payments. When we employ another company to perform a
    function of this nature, we only provide them with the information
    that they need to perform their specific function.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Partner Sponsors: If you win a Contest
    that is sponsored by a Partner Sponsor (as those terms are defined in
    the Terms of Service), Tracks may disclose your Personal Data to the
    Partner Sponsor and the Partner Sponsor may use such Personal Data
    and disclose such Personal Data to third parties in order to notify
    you that you have won, provide you with an opportunity to claim your
    prize, obtain your consent and release with respect to your Contest
    Entry and prize and otherwise in connection with the administration
    and operation of the Contest and prize fulfillment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Legal Requirements: Tracks may disclose
    your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in the good faith
    belief that such action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal
    obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of Tracks,
    (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of
    users of the Service or the public, or (iv) protect against legal
    liability.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">YOUR CHOICES</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">You can access the Site without
    providing any Personal Data. If you choose not to provide any
    Personal Data, you may not be able to use certain features of the
    Service. You can also opt-out of certain uses of your Personal Data
    by modifying your account settings within the Service.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">EXCLUSIONS</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Privacy Policy does not apply to
    any Personal Data collected by Tracks other than Personal Data
    collected through the Service. This Privacy Policy shall not apply to
    any unsolicited information you provide to Tracks through the Service
    or through any other means. This includes, but is not limited to,
    information posted to any public areas of the Service, such as
    bulletin boards, any ideas for new products or modifications to
    existing products, and other unsolicited submissions (collectively,
    &ldquo;Unsolicited Information&rdquo;). All Unsolicited Information
    shall be deemed to be non-confidential and Tracks shall be free to
    reproduce, use, disclose, distribute and exploit such Unsolicited
    Information without limitation or attribution.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">CHILDREN</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Tracks does not knowingly collect
    Personal Data from children under the age of 13. If you are under the
    age of 13, please do not submit any Personal Data through the
    Service. We encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their
    children's Internet usage and to help enforce our Privacy Policy by
    instructing their children never to provide Personal Data through the
    Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that
    a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal Data to Tracks
    through the Service, please contact us, and we will endeavor to
    delete that information from our databases.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">This Privacy Policy applies only to the
    Service. The Service may contain links to other web sites not
    operated or controlled by Tracks (the &ldquo;Third Party Sites&rdquo;).
    The policies and procedures we described here do not apply to the
    Third Party Sites. The links from the Service do not imply that
    Tracks endorses or has reviewed the Third Party Sites. We suggest
    contacting those sites directly for information on their privacy
    policies.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">INTEGRATING THIRD PARTY SERVICES WITHIN
    THE SERVICE</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">One of the special features of the
    Service is that it allows you to enable various online third party
    services, such as social media and social networking services (&ldquo;Third
    Party Services&rdquo;), to be directly integrated into your Tracks
    experience. By directly integrating these services, we make your
    online experiences richer, and more personalized. To take advantage
    of this feature, we will ask you to provide us your username and
    password for the relevant Third Party Services. By enabling such
    Third Party Services, you are allowing us to pass your log-in
    information to these service providers for this purpose. When you add
    a Third Party Service account to the Service, we will collect your
    login information and other relevant information necessary to enable
    the Service to access that Third Party Service and your data
    contained within that Third Party Service. However, please remember
    that the manner in which Third Party Services use, store and disclose
    your information is governed solely by the policies of such third
    parties, and Tracks shall have no liability or responsibility for the
    privacy practices or other actions of any Third Party Service that
    may be enabled within the Service.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">SECURITY</P>

    protect the Personal Data provided via the Service from loss, misuse,
    and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.
